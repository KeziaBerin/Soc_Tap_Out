1)Introduction to Open-Source Simulator Iverilog
   >Learned how to write a simple Verilog testbench.
    ->Explored basic simulation concepts using Iverilog.

2)Labs Using Iverilog and GTKWave
    ->Hands-on lab sessions to practice writing and simulating Verilog code.
    ->Lab 1: Introduction to lab environment and simulation workflow.
    ->Lab 2 (Part 1 & Part 2): Learned to view simulation results using GTKWave.

3)Introduction to Yosys and Logic Synthesis
    ->Learned about Yosys, an open-source tool for logic synthesis.
    ->Studied the basics of logic synthesis and its workflow (Part 1 & Part 2).

4)Labs Using Yosys and Sky130 PDKs
    ->Practiced synthesizing digital designs, specifically a good mux, using Yosys.
    ->Lab sessions were split into three parts, allowing step-by-step understanding of synthesis and netlist generation.
