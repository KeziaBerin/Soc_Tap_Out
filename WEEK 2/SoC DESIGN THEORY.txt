# Fundamentals of SoC Design & BabySoC Learning Journey

## Introduction
A System-on-Chip (SoC) integrates multiple electronic components onto a single chip, including:
- CPU/GPU cores
- Memory units (RAM, ROM, Cache)
- Peripherals (UART, GPIO, Timers, etc.)
- Bus and communication interfaces

SoCs are widely used in smartphones, embedded systems, IoT devices, and automotive electronics due to their high performance, low power consumption, and compact design. Learning SoC design bridges digital electronics theory with practical chip development skills.

## Key Fundamentals of SoC Design

### 1. System Specification & Architecture
- Define performance goals, power limits, and functional requirements.
- Choose IP blocks and plan their interaction.
- Use block diagrams to visualize system structure.

### 2. RTL Design & IP Integration
- Design each block in RTL (Verilog/SystemVerilog).
- Integrate modules via standard bus protocols like AXI, APB, or AHB.
- Ensure timing correctness and protocol compliance.

### 3. Verification
- Unit-level testing: Check individual blocks.
- System-level simulation: Validate block interactions.
- Formal verification: Mathematically prove correctness.

### 4. Synthesis & Physical Design
- Convert RTL into gate-level netlist.
- Perform floorplanning, placement, and routing.
- Conduct timing analysis and power optimization.

### 5. Fabrication & Testing
- After DRC/LVS checks, the design goes for tape-out.
- Post-fabrication: test chip functionality and load firmware.
- Ensure the silicon behaves identically to simulations.
