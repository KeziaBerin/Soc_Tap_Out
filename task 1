O1 – Chip Modelling
    ->The design starts with specifications written in C model.
    ->A testbench in C is used to verify the model behavior at a high level before RTL coding.
O2 – RTL Architecture
    ->The soft copy of the hardware is created in RTL (Verilog).
    ->At this stage, the architecture of the processor and peripherals/IPs is defined.
    ->Output: RTL descriptions that represent the digital system.
O3 – Gate-Level & Integration
    ->RTL is synthesized into a Gate-Level Netlist.
    ->Different components are handled:
        1.Processor – usually soft logic.
        2.Peripherals/IPs – functional blocks.
        3.Macros (Synthesized RTL) and Analog IPs.
    ->These blocks are brought together in SoC integration, including GPIO connections.
Physical Design (RTL2GDS Flow)
    After integration, the chip goes through floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), and routing
    Output is GDSII format after performing DRC/LVS checks.
    Some blocks like macros and analog IPs may be hardened (Hard Macros).
O4 – Final SoC for Applications
    ->The final SoC is running at 100–130 MHz and it can be used in real products such as:
        * iWatch
        * Arduino boards
        * TV panels
        * AC applications
    ->At this stage, O1 = O2 = O3 = O4, meaning specifications, RTL, integration, and physical design are consistent.
SUMMARY
    ->output of GCC = specification in C model
    ->soft copy of hardware - model the specification in certain language like verilog
    ->O1 shoul be equal to O2
    ->soft copy of hardware is divided into processor and peripherals/IPs
